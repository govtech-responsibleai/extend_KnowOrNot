awarded for failing to belt up.

LIGHTS
103 At night (between 7.00pm and 7.00am) you must drive with your headlights on.
104 At night always drive well within the limits of your
headlights. Beware of pedestrians standing on the central
divider because it is difficult to see them when dazzled by the
lights of oncoming vehicles.
105 Use dipped headlights at night in built-up areas and during
rainy weather.
Pedestrian is invisible to driver

106 On unlit roads always use your high beam. Dip your headlights when meeting other vehicles and cyclists. If you are dazzled by
the lights of another vehicle, slow down and stop if necessary.
