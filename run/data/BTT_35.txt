white multi-lingual text on a brown background with white
borders, white arrows and pictures.

VEHICLE MARKINGS
48 Vehicles carrying dangerous goods are required to display
hazard information signs,
e.g. DANGER- HIGHLY FLAMMABLE.

49 Long vehicles are required to display at least 3 yellow
reflective markings on each side of the vehicle and at least
1 red reflective marking at the rear of the vehicle. This is to
make them more conspicuous to other road users, especially
at night.
Long vehicles comprise:
(a) Goods vehicles with length exceeding 10 metres;
(b) Trailers with length exceeding 5 metres; and
(c) Mobile cranes with length exceeding 10 metres
(Note: Mobile cranes require fitting of rear markings only).

50 Vehicle speed limit
Buses, goods vehicles and trailers are required to display a
marking showing the maximum speed in kilometres per
hour at which the vehicle may be driven or, in the case of a
trailer, drawn on a road. Such vehicles must not travel faster
than their vehicle speed limit or the posted road speed limit,
whichever is lower.
