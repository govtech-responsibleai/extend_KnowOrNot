TRAFFIC RULES & REGULATIONS

Driving On Expressways / Yellow-Box Junctions

DRIVING ON EXPRESSWAYS
90 Do not drive, move or stop on road shoulder or verge unless in the event of a breakdown, accident or emergency.
91 Vehicles which have a speed limit of 60 km/h and below shall be driven along the left hand lane of the expressway.
92 Cycling, skating and walking are prohibited on expressways.

YELLOW-BOX JUNCTIONS
93 It is an offence for any driver to drive his/her vehicle into a junction marked with a yellow box and cause obstruction even if the
lights are in his/her favour. However, there are certain situations in which a driver or rider will not be penalised for entering the
yellow-box junction.
(a) Situation One
The first is when the turning vehicles in a box-junction do not block other vehicles. Only drivers of turning vehicles A, B and C
and NOT those marked X may enter the yellow box when their exit lanes from it are blocked by other vehicles. Should the traffic
lights change to red, vehicles A, B and C would not cause any obstruction to other vehicles. However, vehicles marked X would
be obstructing traffic should the lights change and the drivers will be penalised, as such they should wait behind the stop-line at
‘Y’.
