USEFUL INFORMATION
PARKING IN URA/HDB CAR PARKS
237 Coupon Parking System
(a) Please read the car park signboard carefully when parking your vehicle at any HDB or URA car park. Besides the car park
signboard, motorists are advised to look out for other parking restrictions signs within the car park.
(b) The car park signboard, which is located either at the entrance of each car park or along the public road, will indicate the
different parking schemes, their operating hours and parking rates available in the car parks.
(c) Sufficient coupons must be displayed to cover the parking period. The relevant tabs must be torn off completely to indicate
the date and start time of parking the vehicle.
(d) Displaying a coupon with any irregularity which indicates that the coupon has been tampered with (e.g. tabs with
folded/creased marks) is a serious offence. Such offences are chargeable in Court.
(e) Parking coupons can be purchased from authorised sales outlets.
238 Electronic Parking System
(a) Some HDB/URA car parks use the Electronic Parking System (EPS). With EPS, parking charges are on a per-minute basis.
(b) For short-term parking, the system reads the In-Vehicle Unit (IU) numbers of the vehicles entering the car park. Payment of
parking charges can be through cash card or EZ-link card.
(c) For season parking, the system captures the IU numbers of the season parking ticket holder’s vehicle for identification, to
allow the vehicle to enter and leave the car park.
(d) For more information, please visit www.hdb.gov.sg or www.ura.gov.sg.
