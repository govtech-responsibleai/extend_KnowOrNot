Expressway Monitoring and Advisory Systems (EMAS)

(b) TRAFFIC INFORMATION DISPLAY (TID) ON EXPRESSWAYS / SELECTED MAJOR ARTERIAL
ROADS
These large displays found along the expressways and selected major arterial roads display traffic information in text and
simple graphic display up to seven colours. They inform motorists of traffic conditions ahead. A red cross indicates location
with reference to the expressway exits or major road names labelled. A flashing red bar indicates road closure ahead. TIDs
may also display information on incident type, lane(s) affected, congestion information, travel time information or other
traffic advisory messages.
For example, if there is an accident on ECP in the direction towards Airport between Bayshore and Tampines exits, the TID
below will alert motorists in advance for them to react accordingly.

Incident occurs between
2 exits (e.g. Bayshore
and Tampines exits on
ECP)

The TID on the left displays traffic information
